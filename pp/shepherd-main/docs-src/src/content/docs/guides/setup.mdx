## Upgrade your tours to full user journeys


To take your tours further and have more informed experiences, you can unlock event tracking with a Pro account. After signing up at [https://shepherdpro.com](https://shepherdpro.com), you will take your API key to initialize and connect events to your account.

First, you'll need to install the Pro package:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
  ```bash 
  npm install @shepherdpro/pro-js --save 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
  ```bash 
  yarn add @shepherdpro/pro-js 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
  ```bash 
  pnpm add @shepherdpro/pro-js 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
  ```bash 
  bun add @shepherdpro/pro-js 
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


To get started, add your key via the `init` method:

```javascript
import Shepherd from '@shepherdpro/pro-js';

Shepherd.init({YOUR API KEY});
```

Then, if you've created journeys in the application and added targeting that is 
met, a journey will be shown to your user. Otherwise, you can also still programmatically 
start a journey in your application by using the `startJourney` method and passing the ID
of the journey. 

```javascript
Shepherd.`startJourney`('custom-UUID');
```

### startJourney()

> **startJourney**(`id`): `Promise`\<`Tour | undefined`\>

Start the journey by ID, if found

#### Parameters

â€¢ **id**: `string`

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`Tour | undefined`\>
